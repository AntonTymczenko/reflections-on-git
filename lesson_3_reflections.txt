When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To work from different computers and/or to collaborate with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To see changes made by another participants only when I want to see it.
    For instance, before merge. This way I won't be confused by some files
    that were created while I was making my own commits.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are just like clones, but between GitHub repos. Branches are inside 
    the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It can help to avoid future merging conflicts if you work on the same branch
    as your collaborators.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would use some of collaborator's local repository as a origin and accor-
    dingly to that would manage our project. Forking wouldn't be able to do.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Working on different branches and making pull requests can help to avoid
    conflicts between code versions of different collaborators.
